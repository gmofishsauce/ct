This is a small demo of using the cm-chessboard and chess.js libraries.
It gets the imports right, the styles right (I think - should review),
the HTML right, and the code right (needs to handle exceptions in the
case that the board library thinks a move is legal but the chess library
doesn't, e.g. checks).

To run this, move ../index.html and ../main.js out of the way and run
these instead. Must install cm-chessboard and chess.js using npx first.
